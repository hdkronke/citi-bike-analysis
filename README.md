# Tableau Challenge
## Module 18

For this project I used Tableau to visualize bike usage around Manhattan using public data from Citi Bike.

Data Source: https://citibikenyc.com/system-data

The visualizations I created show details on bike station popularity, trip duration, user demographics, and more!

The charts are also interactive! Highlighting any node or data point will provide more details on that facet of the statistic.
